> **📅 Project Timeline:** Developed in **Semester 1 (jan 2025)**
> **💡 Key Achievement:** My first deep dive into the networking in java, specifically the socket programming, by building a point-to-point communication system.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack
- **Language:** Java
- **Protocol:** TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol)
- **API:** Java Networking API (`java.net.ServerSocket`, `java.net.Socket`)

## ✨ Features & Engineering Impact (X, Y, Z)
- **Bi-directional Communication (X):** Established a full-duplex communication channel (Y) by implementing dedicated Input/Output streams for both Server and Client (Z).
- **Socket Reliability (X):** Ensured 100% message delivery (Y) by utilizing the reliable, connection-oriented nature of the TCP protocol (Z).
- **Graceful Termination:** Implemented proper resource management to close sockets and streams, preventing memory leaks or port-blocking.

## 📈 Evolution
This project represents the start of my engineering journey and my Sem 1 foundation in **Networking**. Transitioning from **Java Sockets** in Semester 1 to **Spring Boot** in Semester 3 shows my commitment to continuous technical growth.
